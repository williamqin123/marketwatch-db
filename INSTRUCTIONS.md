Steps to Set Up Project

1. Accept invite
2. Generate local SSH key then paste in github SSH keys
3. Navagate to the projects folder on your device then clone the repo "git clone git@github.com:Daniel6278/marketwatch-db.git"
4. Set up python virtual environment, "python3 -m venv venv" then activate the environment "source venv/bin/activate" now your terminal should show (venv)
5. Install dependencies "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6. Hopefully that all worked
7. There are two branches currently we can add more if needed, but do most testing on develop branch then once it works push to the main branch, make sure each branch is up to date before starting work and make sure to resolve all chnages before leaving.
8. LMK if you have any questions.
